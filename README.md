# book-store-management-system


# Key Components:
main.py: This is the main entry point of your application. It initializes the bookstore and handles user interactions.

bookstore.py: This module contains the core logic for managing the bookstore. It includes functions for adding, updating, and retrieving book information. You can use a simple JSON file (e.g., books.json) to store book data.

user.py: Implement user-related functionalities, such as user registration, login, and authentication. Store user data in a separate JSON file (e.g., users.json).

order.py: Manage orders, including adding items to the shopping cart, placing orders, and viewing order history. Store order data in a separate JSON file (e.g., orders.json).

utils.py: Include utility functions that may be used across different modules.

# Implementation Steps:
Bookstore Logic:

Read and write book data from/to the books.json file.
Implement functions for adding, updating, and searching for books.
User Management:

Implement user registration and login functionalities.
Store user data in the users.json file.
Ensure password security (hashing).
Order Management:

Implement a shopping cart where users can add and remove items.
Allow users to place orders and view order history.
Update book availability after an order is placed.
Console UI (main.py):

Create a console-based interface for users to interact with the bookstore.
Use menus, input prompts, and clear displays to make the interface user-friendly.
Error Handling and Validation:

Implement proper error handling and validation for user inputs.
Handle cases where users try to buy out-of-stock items or perform invalid actions.
Testing:

Test each module and function to ensure that the application behaves as expected.
Documentation:

Add comments and docstrings to explain the functionality of your code.
User Experience:

Consider ways to enhance the user experience within the console interface.
